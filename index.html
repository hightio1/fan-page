            <h2> History of Retro Games </h2>
            <p> Retro gaming is generally classified as anything earlier than the Playstation 2 console.
                <br> This includes a lot of games and consoles from around 1980 to the year 2000. Many people
                <br> like myself grew up playing these games and are very fond of them. Below is a list of
                <br> the most common retro gaming consoles. </p>
            <div id="games">
                <ul>
                    <li>Nintendo NES</li>
                    <li>Super Nintendo</li>
                    <li>Sega Genesis</li>
                    <li>Nintendo 64</li>

                <h3> Retro Game Value <br> </h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the people who grew up with video games feeling older, the popularity of retro video games has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. Many people become excited about the thought of playing through Super Mario World or Donkey Kong Country again, and are willing to pay for that experience. This has caused the value of the games to go up dramatically. Your old box of Nintendo games in your attic could be worth a lot more than you would expect.

            <div>
                <h3> <span class ="redtext"> How do I check the value?</span> </h3>
                <p>There are two main ways to check the value of your retro video games that are generally accepted.</p>
                <div id="linkcolors">
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.pricecharting.com">Price Charting</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p> Price charting is fairly straight forward. You enter the game name and system you are looking for, and it will tell you the loose, complete, and new prices. Ebay is a little trickier, but ultimately more accurate. To use ebay, you need to navigate to the main site and search the "sold" listings for the item you are looking to sell. The most recent ones that match your condition are a very good indicator of current market value. There may be some outliers so you will want to check a couple of them. </p>
